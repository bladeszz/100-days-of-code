# 100 Days of Code: Journey to Web3 Development 

I am a 3rd-year Computer Science student from Turkey, dedicated to mastering Web2 fundamentals and transitioning into the Web3/Blockchain ecosystem. This repository serves as a "Proof of Work" for my 100-day discipline challenge.

## My Goals
- **Mastering JavaScript & React:** Building robust and interactive frontends.
- **Blockchain Core:** Understanding PoW, PoS, and ZK-Proofs.
- **Smart Contract Development:** Learning Solidity and Foundry.
- **DApp Integration:** Connecting frontends to the blockchain via Ethers.js/Viem.

## Tech Stack (The Roadmap)
- **Web2:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React.js.
- **Web3:** Solidity, Foundry, Ethers.js, Hardhat.
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux.
